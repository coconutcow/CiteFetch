# DOI to APA Citation Formatter

This Python script retrieves the metadata for a paper using the Crossref API, constructs a citation string in APA style, and returns it.

## Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.5 or later installed on your machine. You will also need the `requests` library. If you don't have it installed, you can use pip:


```
pip install requests
```

## Usage

python

```python
from get_citation import get_citation_from_doi  # assuming you saved the script as get_citation.py

print(get_citation_from_doi('10.1145/3290605.3300764'))  # replace with your DOI
```

Replace `'10.1145/3290605.3300764'` with the DOI of the paper you want to get the citation for.

## Output

The script will print out the citation in APA style, for example:

```
D. Ma, L. Cao, N. Wang, D. He, and T. D. Nadeem (2019). A Survey on Open Information Extraction. 2019 20th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT). https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300764
```

## Limitations

The formatting here is quite simple and may not handle all edge cases. There can be many edge cases in citation formatting (like handling multiple authors, editors, different types of publications, etc.) that are not covered by this simple script.

## Disclaimer

Please verify all citations generated by this script.
